## Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a poor guy that tries to improve world with programming and teach something new.

- Currently working on tools to translate RPG Maker games, such as a Tauri GUI powered by my Rust CLI tool rvpacker-json-txt and TypeScript library @savannstm/marshal.
- I'm currently learning Rust and TypeScript.
- I'm looking to collaborate on anything that will help people, will be available publicly, and I'm interested in.
- I'm looking for help with maintaining my repositories and improving their code quality.
- How to reach me: via email or my social accounts.
- Fun fact: I live with my mother.
