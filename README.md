## Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a poor guy that tries to improve world with programming and teach something new.

- Currently working on tools to translate RPG Maker games, such as a Tauri GUI powered by my Rust CLI tool `rvpacker-txt-rs` and Rust library `marshal-rs`.
- I'm currently improving myself in Rust and TypeScript.
- I'm looking to collaborate on anything that will help people, will be available publicly, and I'm interested in.
- I'm looking for help with maintaining my repositories and improving their code quality.
- How to reach me: via email or my social accounts.

If something I've developed has been useful for you, please, consider supporting me on [Boosty](https://boosty.to/mcdeimos). It'd be of great help for me.
